This is my solution to the water flow challenge in javascript.

The challenge is to find the path of least resistance from left to right given a matrix of resistances.

If the resistance is >50, the water cannot continue.


It's all working except that the maximum size grid (10 x 100) ends up timing out in javascript.. (derp).  So I commented out that test for now.
